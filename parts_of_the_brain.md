### The Brain and Its Functions

The brain is divided into several parts, each responsible for specific functions. This functional specialization means that damage to different parts of the brain results in different effects. Functional brain imaging techniques like fMRI and PET scans help us understand these functions by showing which areas are active during various tasks.

#### The Brain and Spinal Cord
- **Spinal Cord**: Certain reflexive activities, like sucking in newborns, limb withdrawal from pain, or vomiting, can occur without the brain's involvement.
- **Brain**: For most activities discussed in neuroscience and psychology, the brain is the primary focus.

#### Subcortical Structures (Below the Cortex)
- **Medulla**: Controls automatic functions such as heart rate, blood pressure, and swallowing.
- **Cerebellum**: Involved in body balance and muscle coordination, containing about 30 billion neurons.
- **Hypothalamus**: Regulates feeding, sex, thirst, and other appetites.

#### Cerebral Cortex (Outer Layer of the Brain)
- **Structure**: Highly folded, about two square feet if unfolded, and around three millimeters thick.
- **Functions**: Responsible for reasoning, language, and complex perception.
  - **Evolution**: Fish lack a cerebral cortex, reptiles and birds have a small one, while primates, including humans, have a significant amount.

#### Lobes of the Cerebral Cortex
- **Frontal Lobe**: Located at the front, involved in executive functions, motor control, and language production.
- **Parietal Lobe**: Processes sensory information related to touch, temperature, and pain.
- **Occipital Lobe**: Primarily responsible for vision.
- **Temporal Lobe**: Involved in auditory processing and memory.

#### Maps in the Cortex
- **Topographical Maps**: Close areas in the body correspond to close areas in the brain.
  - **Motor Area**: Stimulation causes specific body parts to move.
  - **Somatosensory Area**: Stimulation causes sensations like touch or sound.
- **Disproportionate Representation**: Areas like the hands and face have larger cortical representation due to their high sensory and motor function.

#### Projection Areas and Higher Functions
- **Projection Areas**: Less than a quarter of the cortex; involved in sensory processing and motor control.
- **Association Areas**: Involved in higher functions like language, reasoning, and moral thoughts.

### Understanding Brain Function and Damage
- **Imaging Techniques**: MRI and other scans show active brain areas during various tasks.
- **Natural Experiments**: Studying individuals with brain damage (tumors, strokes, accidents) reveals which functions are affected by damage to specific brain regions.

### Brain Disorders from Damage
- **Apraxia**: Difficulty coordinating movements into complex actions.
- **Agnosia**: Disorders of perception; difficulty recognizing objects or faces (prosopagnosia).
- **Sensory Neglect**: Ignoring one side of the world, often due to attentional problems.
- **Aphasia**: Language disorders.
  - **Expressive Aphasia (Broca's)**: Difficulty speaking.
  - **Receptive Aphasia**: Difficulty understanding language.
- **Moral and Behavioral Disorders**: Damage affecting moral sense, self-control, and behavior (e.g., cases like Phineas Gage).

### Conclusion
The brain's localization of function demonstrates that specific areas are responsible for distinct tasks. This knowledge challenges dualistic views by showing that physical damage to the brain can profoundly affect mental and moral aspects of a person.
