### Jean Piaget's Four Stages of Cognitive Development

#### 1. Sensorimotor Stage (Birth to ~2 years)
- **Characteristics**:
  - Babies are purely sensory and motoric creatures.
  - Information is gained through senses and motor activities.
  - No reasoning, no sense of time or object permanence.
  - Early lack of differentiation between self and others.
- **Key Concept**: **Object Permanence**
  - Understanding that objects exist independently of one’s actions or perceptions.
  - Example: Before 6 months, babies believe objects removed from sight no longer exist.
  - Peekaboo is amusing because babies think the person disappears when their face is covered.

#### 2. Preoperational Stage (2 to 7 years)
- **Characteristics**:
  - Children start to reason but have significant limitations.
  - Have object permanence, differentiate themselves from others, and have a rudimentary understanding of time.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - **Egocentrism**:
    - Inability to see the world from others’ perspectives.
    - Example: In the Three Mountains Task, children cannot understand how others see the mountains from different angles.
  - **Lack of Conservation**:
    - Failure to understand that certain properties remain constant despite changes in form.
    - Examples:
      - **Number Conservation**: Children think spreading out checkers increases their number.
      - **Volume Conservation**: Children believe pouring water into a taller glass increases its amount.

#### 3. Concrete Operational Stage (7 to 11 years)
- **Characteristics**:
  - Reduced egocentricity and improved logical thought.
  - Children can understand conservation.
- **Limitations**:
  - Struggle with abstract and hypothetical reasoning.
  - Example: Children cannot conduct scientific reasoning like adults, such as experimenting to find causes for issues (e.g., back pain or car noise).

#### 4. Formal Operational Stage (Adolescence to Adulthood)
- **Characteristics**:
  - Full-fledged adult reasoning capabilities.
  - Ability to think abstractly and hypothetically.
- **Piaget's Perspective**:
  - Unlike Freud, Piaget believed no further cognitive development stages occur in adulthood.
  - Natural progression through stages without the need for acceleration.

#### Additional Insights
- **Piaget's Method**:
  - Used interviews and problem-solving tasks with children to understand their reasoning.
- **Stage Theory**:
  - Each stage corresponds to different cognitive abilities and ways of understanding the world.
  - Cognitive development involves restructuring knowledge through assimilation and accommodation.

### Summary
Piaget’s theory outlines a natural progression through distinct stages of cognitive development, from basic sensory interactions in infancy to complex abstract reasoning in adulthood. Each stage builds on the previous one, leading to a more sophisticated understanding of the world.
