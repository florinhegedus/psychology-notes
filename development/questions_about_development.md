### Lecture Topic: Development

#### Developmental Psychology
- **Personal Interest**: The speaker finds development more interesting than most topics due to professional involvement and ongoing research at Yale.
- **Foundational Questions**: Developmental psychology addresses essential and intuitive questions about human nature.

#### Key Questions in Developmental Psychology
1. **Morality and the Origin of Moral Thought**:
   - **Two Views on Morality**:
     - **Immoral/Amoral at Birth**:
       - Influences: Christian doctrine of original sin, Freudian theory of unrestrained appetites (Hobbes and Freud).
     - **Innately Good**:
       - Influences: Rousseau, modern discussions on prejudice and racism, suggesting corruption through culture.
   - **Research Exploration**: Empirical studies on children's morality will be discussed later in the course.

2. **Continuity between Children and Adults**:
   - **Nature vs. Nurture**:
     - The degree to which adult traits are determined from birth or early childhood.
     - Predictive Power of Early Childhood: Studies show a 90-minute interview with a three-year-old can predict future personality, personal relationships, job stability, and criminal behavior.
     - **Poetic Phrase**: "The child is father to the man."

3. **Cognitive Development**:
   - **Three Theories**:
     - **Empiricism**: 
       - Concept: We start empty and learn continuously.
       - Related to: Behaviorism.
     - **Nativism**: 
       - Concept: We are born with innate, complex structures.
       - Associated with: Noam Chomsky.
     - **Constructivism**: 
       - Concept: Learning involves interaction with the environment, and our mind is complex.
       - Associated with: John Piaget.
       - Comparison:
         - Shares with empiricism: The importance of learning and interaction.
         - Shares with nativism: The complexity of the mind and elegant learning processes.

#### Conclusion
- **Overall Goal**: The lecture aims to explore these fundamental questions and theories in developmental psychology, providing insights into how children grow and develop into adults.
