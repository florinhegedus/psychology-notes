### Addressing the Contradictions in Child Development

#### The Problem
- There is evidence that babies have powerful knowledge of the physical and social world.
- Simultaneously, there are studies showing that children think differently and often get things wrong that come naturally to adults.
- An adequate theory of development must explain both what children know and what they don’t know.

#### Illustrative Study: Mean Monkey Experiment
- **Experiment Setup**:
  - Conducted by psychologist Joan Pascal with three-year-old Jacob.
  - Jacob is told that a "mean monkey" always takes the sticker that he really wants.
  - Jacob must try to deceive the monkey to get the sticker he actually wants.

- **Observations**:
  - Despite multiple attempts, Jacob fails to deceive the monkey, showing an inability to understand that he can manipulate what the monkey believes.
  - An older child, Patrick, successfully deceives the monkey, demonstrating an understanding that he can think things that others don’t and that thoughts can be private.

- **Conclusion**:
  - Younger children like Jacob do not grasp the concept of false beliefs or that they can deceive others based on these false beliefs.
  - Older children, around four and a half to five years old, start understanding that others can hold false beliefs and use this to manipulate others' thoughts.

#### Classic Study: Sally & Anne Test
- **Test Setup**:
  - Introduce characters Sally and Anne. Sally has a basket, Anne has a box.
  - Sally puts a marble in her basket and leaves.
  - Anne moves the marble to her box while Sally is away.
  - Sally returns, and the child is asked where Sally will look for her marble.

- **Results**:
  - Adults and older children: "She’ll look in the basket," understanding that Sally holds a false belief.
  - Younger children: "She’ll look in the box," failing to understand that Sally does not know the marble has been moved.

- **Significance**:
  - Demonstrates a major cognitive milestone: understanding that others can hold false beliefs about the world.
  - Children under four to five years old struggle with this concept, while older children begin to grasp it, marking an important developmental transition.

#### Explanation and Theories
- **Neural Development**:
  - Brain development, including pruning and myelination, contributes to cognitive changes.
  - Frontal lobe development plays a key role in inhibition and higher-order thinking.

- **Cognitive and Conceptual Changes**:
  - Piaget’s theory: children think differently from adults, explaining their unique errors.
  - Conceptual changes in children are akin to scientific revolutions, where new theories replace old ones.

- **Social Reasoning and Theory of Mind**:
  - Understanding that others can have false beliefs is a critical component of social reasoning.
  - This ability develops around four to five years of age and significantly changes how children understand and interact with others.

### Summary
Understanding the development of children's cognitive abilities requires addressing both their powerful knowledge and their limitations. Studies like the Mean Monkey experiment and the Sally & Anne test illustrate the progression from an inability to understand false beliefs to the sophisticated social reasoning seen in older children. Neural development and conceptual changes are key factors in this process, providing a comprehensive explanation of how children's minds evolve over time.
