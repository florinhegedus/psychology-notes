### Explaining Development: Different Approaches

#### Neural Changes
- **Neural Pruning**:
  - Development involves a reduction in neural connections rather than an increase.
  - Pruning makes advanced and mature thought possible.
- **Myelination**:
  - Development of the myelin sheath around neurons, which enhances the speed and efficiency of neural transmission.
  - This process continues through adolescence, especially in the frontal lobes.
- **Frontal Lobe Development**:
  - The frontal lobes, crucial for inhibition and higher-order thinking, take time to mature.
  - Immature frontal lobes in children may explain impulsive behavior, illustrated by the "Charlie bit my finger" video where Charlie struggles to stop biting.

#### Cognitive and Conceptual Changes
- **Piagetian Perspective**:
  - Piaget posited that children think differently from adults, explaining failures in conservation tasks and other cognitive tests.
- **Conceptual Change**:
  - Susan Carey likens children's conceptual change to scientific revolutions, influenced by Thomas Kuhn's work.
  - The shift from Newtonian to Einsteinian physics mirrors the cognitive shift from childhood to adulthood.

#### Theories in Developmental Psychology
- **Large-Scale Changes**:
  - Freud and Piaget believed in major developmental shifts between childhood and adulthood.
  - Susan Carey also supports this view, suggesting profound changes in theories of the world as children develop.
- **Modular Development**:
  - Alternative theory focuses on specific cognitive modules with unique developmental trajectories.
  - Modules are specialized systems for physical understanding, social reasoning, etc., with innate knowledge.
  - Case study: Autism may be due to damage in the social reasoning module, as autistic individuals struggle with tasks requiring social inference.

#### Specific Modules in Cognitive Development
- **Understanding Physical World**:
  - Modules for physical knowledge (e.g., naive physics).
- **Social Understanding**:
  - Theory of mind or naive psychology modules for social cognition.
  - Autism studies highlight deficits in these areas.
- **Other Proposed Modules**:
  - Naive sociology for understanding groups, naive biology for the biological world.

#### Role of Language in Cognitive Development
- **Language Acquisition**:
  - Significant differences between pre-linguistic children and adults.
  - Learning to speak may alter cognitive processes and understanding of the world.
  - This topic will be explored in the next lecture on language development.

#### Relevance of Studying Development
- **Importance for Understanding Adults**:
  - Studying children provides insights into adult psychology.
  - Example: Stephen Jay Gould's question about zebra stripesâ€”studying zebra development answers whether they are white with black stripes or black with white stripes.
  - **Wisdom of Darcy Thompson**: "Everything is the way it is because it got that way."

### Summary
Developmental psychology explores multiple approaches to understanding cognitive and behavioral changes from infancy to adulthood. Neural changes, Piagetian theory, conceptual shifts, and modular development offer diverse explanations. The study of language acquisition and its impact on cognition further enriches this field. Understanding development is crucial not only for comprehending children's minds but also for gaining insights into adult psychology.
