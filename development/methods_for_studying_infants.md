### Methods for Studying Infant Cognition

#### Neuroscientific Methods
- **Brain Scanning**:
  - Machines scan a baby’s brain while they look at displays or ponder something.
  - Offers an elegant way to explore the mental life of non-verbal infants.
  - This exciting work is ongoing and holds promise for deeper insights.

#### Behavioral Methods

1. **Sucking Behavior**:
   - **Pacifier and Headphones Experiment**:
     - Babies suck on a pacifier while listening to sounds.
     - Used to determine preferences, such as a baby preferring their mother’s voice over a stranger’s.
     - Also used to test language preferences (e.g., English vs. Russian).

2. **Looking Behavior**:
   - **Visual Attention**:
     - Babies control where they look, which can indicate recognition and understanding.
   - **Habituation**:
     - Babies get bored with repeated stimuli (e.g., seeing blue objects repeatedly).
     - Renewed interest in new stimuli (e.g., seeing green objects after blue) indicates discrimination between different stimuli.
   - **Surprise and Expectation**:
     - Babies look longer at surprising events (e.g., a hat floating to a head).
     - Indicates that babies have expectations about the world (e.g., objects behave according to physical laws).

#### Examples of Looking Time Studies

1. **Object Permanence**:
   - **Brick and Stick Study**:
     - Babies see the top and bottom of a stick moving behind a brick.
     - They expect a whole stick, showing understanding of object permanence.

2. **Block and Screen Study**:
   - Babies see a block hidden by a screen.
   - If the block is removed and the screen falls completely, babies are surprised.
   - Indicates they expect the block to remain and obstruct the screen.

3. **Numerical Knowledge**:
   - **Addition and Subtraction Studies**:
     - Babies observe basic arithmetic scenarios (e.g., one toy added to another).
     - Surprise at incorrect outcomes (e.g., one toy instead of two) indicates a rudimentary understanding of numbers.

4. **Social Understanding**:
   - **Face Recognition**:
     - Babies prefer looking at face-like shapes.
   - **Moral Preferences**:
     - Babies watch a puppet show where one puppet behaves kindly and another selfishly.
     - When asked to choose, about 70% of babies prefer the kind puppet.
     - Suggests an early glimmer of moral sense.

### Summary
These diverse methods provide rich insights into the cognitive abilities of infants, challenging earlier assumptions about their knowledge and understanding. Modern studies reveal that babies possess significant physical, numerical, and social knowledge, showcasing their surprising cognitive sophistication from a very young age.
