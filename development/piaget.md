### Lecture Segment: Jean Piaget and Developmental Psychology

#### Introduction to Key Psychologists
- **Prominent Figures**:
  - **Sigmund Freud**: Widely recognized in general psychology.
  - **B.F. Skinner**: Known for his contributions to behaviorism.
  - **Jean Piaget**: The most recognized name in developmental psychology.

#### Jean Piaget's Contribution
- **Founding Modern Developmental Psychology**:
  - Pioneered methods, observations, and theories foundational to the field.
  - Influenced a vibrant school of thought with many students and significant impact.

#### Genetic Epistemology
- **Focus**:
  - Piaget's primary interest was in the development of knowledge in humans.
  - Studied individual children to infer the development of knowledge in the human species.
  - **Ontogeny Recapitulates Phylogeny**: The development of the species is mirrored in the development of each individual.

#### Piaget's View on Children
- **Children as Active Thinkers**:
  - Described children as "little scientists" trying to understand the world.
  - Introduced the concept of **schemas** (mental systems/frameworks).

#### Mechanisms of Schema Transformation
- **Assimilation**:
  - Integrating new information and experiences into existing schemas.
  - Example: A baby adapting the sucking schema from mother's breast to a rattle or toes.
- **Accommodation**:
  - Modifying existing schemas or creating new ones to fit new information and experiences.
  - Example: Adjusting the sucking schema for different objects.

#### Piaget's Research Method
- **Interviews with Children**:
  - Engaged children in solving problems and dealing with different situations.
  - Intensive questioning to understand their reasoning.
- **Radical View**:
  - Children think differently from adults.
  - Contrasted with nativists (innate knowledge) and empiricists/behaviorists (learning through accumulation and conditioning).

#### Theory of Development
- **Stages of Development**:
  - Theories transform through a series of stages.
  - Each stage represents a different style of thinking and understanding.
  - **Comparison to Freud**:
    - Freud's stages (psychosexual) vs. Piaget's stages (intellectual and reasoning-based).
    - Piaget's theory is considered to have a stronger scientific basis.

#### Conclusion
- **Piaget's Influence**:
  - His theories on cognitive development and the stages of learning continue to shape our understanding of how children develop knowledge and reasoning skills.
