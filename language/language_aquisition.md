### Language Acquisition

#### Introduction
- **Language Acquisition**: The process by which we go from a baby with no language knowledge to an adult fluent in language.
- **Noam Chomsky's Perspective**: 
  - Chomsky, a prominent linguist, critic of Skinner's behaviorism, and proponent of nativism, argues that much of our knowledge, including language, is innate.
  - **Nativism**: The idea that we are born with a significant amount of knowledge, particularly regarding language.

#### Chomsky's View on Language Development
- **Quote**: "No one would take seriously the proposal that the human organism learns through experience to have arms rather than wings, or that the basic structure of particular organs results from accidental experience. [Language] proves to be no less marvelous and intricate than these physical structures.. Why, then, should we not study the acquisition of a cognitive structure like language more or less as we study some complex bodily organ?"
- **Language as Growth**: Chomsky suggests that language acquisition is more akin to growth rather than learning.

#### Evidence Supporting Nativism
- **Universality**: Every human society has language, and all normal children acquire it.
- **Specific Impairments**: Brain damage, trauma, developmental, or genetic disorders can specifically impair language ability, even in intelligent and communicative individuals.
- **Minimal Teaching Required**: Children learn to speak without direct teaching or reinforcement.

#### Language Learning Involves Learning
- **Phonetic Properties**: Learning which phonemes are used in a language (e.g., English distinguishes between L and R, other languages may not).
- **Word Meanings (Morphology)**: Learning the meanings of words (e.g., English "dog", French "chien").
- **Syntax**: Learning the structure of sentences (e.g., "Bill hit John" vs. "John hit Bill").

#### Stages of Language Development
- **Birth**:
  - Infants prefer listening to their native language.
  - Capable of distinguishing all phonemes of natural languages.
- **Around 7 Months**:
  - Begin babbling (e.g., "ba-ba-ba", "pa-pa-pa").
  - Deaf children babble with their hands if learning sign language.
- **First Words**:
  - Typically around the first birthday.
  - Words for objects, actions, and properties (e.g., "momma", "dadda", "milk", "give", "up", "hot").
- **Sensitivity to Word Order**:
  - Early understanding of word order in sentences (e.g., "big bird is pushing Cookie Monster").
- **Telegraphic Speech (1.5 Years)**:
  - Two-word sentences (e.g., "milk gone").
  - Increase in word learning rate.
- **Gradual Appearance of Function Morphemes**:
  - Words like "in", "of", "a", plural marker "-s", past tense marker "-ed".
- **Language Development Continues**:
  - Learning becomes more difficult with age.
  - Critical period for language acquisition exists.

#### Critical Period for Language Learning
- **Study on Language Learning**:
  - Comparison of language acquisition at different ages.
  - **Findings**: The older you start learning a language past age three, the less proficient you become.
  - **Critical Period**: Biological capacity to learn language has a developmental window.

### Summary
Language acquisition involves both innate abilities and learning. While Chomsky's nativist perspective emphasizes the innate aspects of language, it is clear that exposure to and interaction with language in the environment is crucial. Children go through various stages of development, starting from an ability to distinguish phonemes to producing complex sentences. The existence of a critical period highlights the importance of early language exposure for achieving fluency.
