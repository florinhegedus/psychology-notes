### Language: An Introduction to Its Universality and Complexity

#### Demonstration of Language Diversity and Universality
- **Class Exercise**: In an introductory psychology course at Yale, a demonstration involves students from different countries saying the sentence "The girl thinks that the house is big" in their native languages.
- **Languages Represented**: Includes English, French, Spanish, Mandarin, Turkish, Russian, Japanese, and many more.
- **Key Observations**:
  - **Expressive Power**: All languages can express abstract notions.
  - **Sound Differences**: Languages sound different and are often incomprehensible to speakers of other languages.

#### Language as an Instinct
- **Charles Darwin's Observation**: Humans have an instinctive tendency to speak, unlike other learned activities like baking or writing.
- **Universality**: Every human society has a language, indicating its instinctive nature.
- **Contrast with Other Human Inventions**: Unlike soccer or Coca-Cola, which spread through human innovation, language is inherent to human societies.

#### Evidence of Language Instinct: Creolization
- **Creolization**:
  - **Historical Context**: Occurred among slaves and laborers from different language backgrounds.
  - **Pidgin**: A makeshift jargon without grammar used for basic communication.
  - **Children's Role**: Children exposed to pidgin transform it into a fully developed language (creole) with syntax, morphology, and phonology.
- **Modern Examples**:
  - **Deaf Children**: Deaf children born to hearing parents often develop a creole-like sign language from the pidgin-like sign language of their parents.

#### Language Acquisition in Children
- **Universality**: By the age of three or four, all normal children have acquired language.
- **Brain Specialization**: Specific areas in the brain are devoted to language.
- **Controversy**: The debate on whether language capacity is specific to language or part of general cognitive abilities.

#### Creativity in Language
- **Creativity Defined**: The ability to produce and understand an infinite number of sentences.
- **Demonstration**: Students can produce sentences never heard before, demonstrating that language use isn't just rote memory.
- **Rules and Principles**: Understanding language involves abstract, unconscious rules, not prescriptive grammar rules taught in schools.

#### Levels of Language
- **Phonology**: The sound system of language.
- **Morphology**: The composition of words.
- **Syntax**: The combination of words to form phrases and sentences.

#### Examples of Language Rules
- **Sentence Interpretation**:
  - **"The pig is eager to eat"**: The pig is doing the eating.
  - **"The pig is easy to eat"**: The pig is being eaten.
  - **Pronoun Reference**:
    - **"Bill knew John liked him"**: Can mean John likes Bill.
    - **"Bill knew that John liked himself"**: Means John likes John.

#### Conclusion
- **Linguistics**: The study of language rules and principles.
- **Fascination with Language**: Understanding how we interpret and produce language can lead to a career in linguistics, exploring phonology, morphology, and syntax.
