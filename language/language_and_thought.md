### Advanced Topics in the Study of Language

#### Additional Areas of Study
- **Language in the Brain**: Investigates how neurons and neural systems encode language.
- **Language Disorders**: Examines various language impairments and their effects.
- **Reading**:
  - Reading involves language but is not universal.
  - It is a recent human invention and can be challenging.
- **Bilingualism and Multilingualism**: Explores how people manage multiple languages in their minds.

#### Language in Other Animals
- **Human vs. Animal Communication**:
  - Animals have communication systems but lack the complexity of human language.
  - Examples: Vervet monkeys (finite calls), bees (continuous signals), birds (song variations).
  - Animals do not exhibit phonology, morphology, syntax, or recursion as humans do.
- **Attempts to Teach Animals**:
  - Chimpanzees and other primates have been taught limited vocabularies with little success in mastering human-like language structures.
  - Example: Nim Chimpsky's repetitive and simplistic utterances like "Nim eat" and "Give orange me."

#### Language Processing
- **Influence of Knowledge and Expectations**:
  - Our understanding of language influences how we perceive it.
  - Example: The segmentation of speech into words is influenced by knowledge of the language.
  - Demonstration: A garbled sentence becomes clear once its meaning is known ("The study drench is worse than a drenching rain").

#### Relationship Between Language and Thought
- **Influence of Language on Thought**:
  - Language can convey and influence thoughts.
  - The question: Does the language you learn change the way you think?
- **Cross-Linguistic Differences**:
  - Example: English and Korean have different prepositional systems affecting spatial relations.
  - Example: Languages with specific plural markers might influence numerical cognition.
- **Is Language Necessary for Abstract Thought?**:
  - Language may be intertwined with cognitive abilities like logic, mathematics, and social structures.
  - Charles Darwin and Dan Dennett speculated on the integral role of language in developing advanced cognitive faculties.

#### Evidence from False Belief and Number Tasks
- **False Belief Tasks**:
  - Involves understanding that others can hold false beliefs.
  - Studies suggest that language is not necessary for understanding false beliefs.
  - Evidence: Even 15-month-olds and people with severe aphasia can pass false belief tests.
- **Numerical Cognition**:
  - Language seems crucial for understanding precise numerical relationships.
  - Non-linguistic creatures (e.g., babies, dogs, chimpanzees) can perform basic arithmetic but lack understanding of exact numbers.
  - Example: Stanislas Dehaene's assertion that without symbols, distinguishing specific numbers like 8 from 9 is challenging.

### Summary
The study of language encompasses various aspects, from the neurological basis of language to its acquisition, processing, and influence on thought. While animals have communication systems, they lack the complexity of human language. Language processing is influenced by our knowledge and expectations. The relationship between language and thought is intricate, with language playing a crucial role in certain cognitive abilities while being less essential for others. Language may be fundamental for precise numerical reasoning and some unique human cognitive abilities, but not for understanding false beliefs. This highlights the multifaceted nature of language and its deep integration with human cognition.
