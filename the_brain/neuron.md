### The Physical Basis of Thought and Emotion: An Overview

The brain, despite its unassuming appearance, is the most complex mechanism in the known universe and the physical basis of thought, emotions, decision-making, passions, and pains. This complexity is grounded in its structure and function, particularly the neurons, which are the core of neuroscience.

### Neurons: The Building Blocks of the Brain

**Structure of Neurons:**
- **Dendrites**: Receive signals from other neurons, which can be excitatory (pluses) or inhibitory (minuses).
- **Cell Body**: Sums up these signals, and if the excitatory signals reach a certain threshold, the neuron fires.
- **Axon**: Transmits the firing signal, often over long distances, and is insulated by the myelin sheath to facilitate fast signal transmission.

**Types of Neurons:**
- **Sensory Neurons**: Take in information from the environment.
- **Motor Neurons**: Transmit signals from the brain to muscles, enabling movement.
- **Interneurons**: Connect different neurons within the brain and spinal cord, without direct contact with the external environment.

### Neural Communication and Synapses

**Neural Firing:**
- Neurons function on an all-or-nothing principle, similar to firing a gun or sneezing.
- The intensity of a sensation is coded by the number of neurons firing and the frequency of their firing.

**Synapses:**
- Neurons communicate across tiny gaps called synapses via neurotransmitters.
- Neurotransmitters can be excitatory or inhibitory, influencing whether the receiving neuron will fire.

### Brain Chemicals and Neurotransmitters

**Neurotransmitters and Drugs:**
- **Curare**: An antagonist that blocks motor neurons, causing paralysis.
- **Alcohol**: Inhibits inhibitory neurons, leading to decreased self-control and, in large doses, loss of consciousness or death.
- **Amphetamines**: Increase norepinephrine, enhancing arousal and energy.
- **Prozac and L-Dopa**: Affect serotonin and dopamine levels, used to treat depression and Parkinson's disease respectively.

### Complexity and Resilience of the Brain

**Computational Neuroscience:**
- The brain is a highly resilient and efficient computational device.
- Unlike computers, the brain's distributed information processing allows it to function even when damaged.
- The brain's slow neural processes are offset by its efficient parallel processing.

### Higher-Level Brain Functions

**Localization of Function:**
- Different brain areas are responsible for specific functions like language, face recognition, and emotional processing.
- Understanding these functions at a higher level allows researchers to connect them to neural networks and specific neuronal behaviors.

### Conclusion

The intricate wiring and function of neurons form the foundation of the brain's incredible capabilities. The study of these neural mechanisms, through the lens of computational neuroscience and neuropharmacology, continues to unveil the mysteries of how this "meat" can produce the richness of human experience and consciousness.
