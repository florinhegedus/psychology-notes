### B.F. Skinner and the Theory of Behaviorism

#### Introduction to B.F. Skinner
- **Comparison with Freud**:
  - **Freud**: Invented Psychoanalysis from scratch.
  - **Skinner**: Built upon and expanded the ideas of predecessors like John Watson, packaging them into the Theory of Behaviorism.
- **Influence**:
  - **Freud**: Major figure during his lifetime and beyond.
  - **Skinner**: Dominated American intellectual life in the 1960s and 1970s with his radical theories.

### Core Claims of Behaviorism

#### 1. Emphasis on Learning
- **Rejection of Innate Ideas**: Behaviorism strongly rejects the concept of innate traits or ideas.
- **Experience-Based**: According to Skinner, everything an individual knows and is, results from their experiences. There is no inherent human nature, and people are infinitely malleable.
- **John Watson's Quote**: 
  - "Give me a dozen healthy infants, well-formed, and my own specified world to bring them up in and I'll guarantee to take any one at random, train them to become any specialist I may select--doctor, lawyer, artist, merchant-chief, and, yes, even beggarman and thief, regardless of his talents, pensions, tendencies, abilities, vocations, and race of his ancestors."
  - **Implication**: This view suggests that anyone can become anything, emphasizing the role of the environment over inherent abilities or traits.

#### 2. Anti-Mentalism
- **Scientific Rigor**: Behaviorists aimed to establish psychology as a rigorous science by avoiding unobservable concepts.
- **Reaction Against Freud**:
  - Freud proposed internal, invisible constructs like defense mechanisms, the id, the superego, and the Oedipus complex.
  - Behaviorists rejected these in favor of observable phenomena such as stimuli, responses, and environmental features.
- **Observable Phenomena**: Focus on measurable and observable behavior rather than internal mental states like desires, wishes, goals, beliefs, and emotions.

#### 3. Cross-Species Learning Principles
- **Uniform Learning Principles**: Behaviorism posits that the principles of learning apply across all species.
- **Species Comparisons**: While acknowledging minor differences in learning speeds (e.g., rats vs. humans, pigeons vs. children), behaviorists argue that the fundamental processes of learning are consistent across species.
- **Radical View**: This perspective suggests that the differences in knowledge and behavior between species are due to the environmental situations in which they are raised, not inherent differences.

### Summary
B.F. Skinner's Theory of Behaviorism presented a radical shift in understanding human behavior, focusing on the role of learning and the environment, rejecting the notion of innate ideas, and emphasizing observable behavior over internal mental states. This theory has had a profound impact on psychology, offering a stark contrast to Freudian theories and influencing the development of scientific approaches to studying behavior across species.
