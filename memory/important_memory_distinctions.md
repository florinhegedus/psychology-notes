### Introduction to Memory

This lecture on memory continues the journey from our perception of the world, through attention, and now to memory. Once you've seen something and attended to it, it gets encoded into your head as a memory. Memory is complex and essential to our understanding of the world, going beyond just autobiographical memory.

### Types of Memory

1. **Implicit vs. Explicit Memory**
   - **Explicit Memory**: Conscious knowledge, such as knowing your name, the capital of Canada, or what you had for breakfast.
   - **Implicit Memory**: Unconscious knowledge, such as knowing your way around a place you've forgotten or understanding a word at a gut level.

2. **Semantic vs. Episodic Memory**
   - **Semantic Memory**: Facts and general knowledge (e.g., the capital of Canada).
   - **Episodic Memory**: Personal experiences and episodes from your life.

### Memory Processes

1. **Encoding**: The process of getting information into your head.
2. **Storage**: The process of keeping information in your head.
3. **Retrieval**: The process of getting information out of your head.

### Memory Tests

1. **Recall vs. Recognition**
   - **Recall**: Freely recounting experiences (e.g., describing what I was wearing during the last lecture).
   - **Recognition**: Identifying the correct option from a set (e.g., choosing the right outfit from pictures).

### Stages of Memory

1. **Sensory Memory**: Initial, brief storage of sensory information.
2. **Short-Term Memory**: Temporary storage of information currently in use.
3. **Long-Term Memory**: Long-lasting storage of information.

### Summary
Memory is integral to everything we know and do, encompassing more than just autobiographical details. Understanding the distinctions between different types of memory and the processes involved in encoding, storing, and retrieving information helps us grasp the complexity of how memory functions in our lives.
