### Forgetting

Forgetting is a natural part of memory, and there are several reasons why it happens:

1. **Decay:**
   - Memories are physical structures in the brain, consisting of patterns of atoms and molecules. Over time, these structures can decay.
   - A study demonstrated this by teaching fish something and then gently heating the tank. The higher the temperature, the more forgetting occurred because the heat caused the memory's molecular structures to dissolve faster.

2. **Interference:**
   - New information can interfere with old information. For example, learning a new phone number can make it harder to remember a previous one.
   - This interference is more significant with similar material. Learning unrelated things, like dance moves, won't affect your memory of a phone number.

3. **Changes in Retrieval Cues:**
   - Over time, the cues that help you retrieve memories can change. Moving houses or workplaces and changing objects around you can make it harder to recall memories associated with previous cues.
   - Although not a major cause, this factor does contribute to forgetting.

### Childhood Amnesia

Childhood amnesia refers to the inability to remember events from early childhood, typically before the age of two or three. Several factors contribute to this phenomenon:
- **Time:** A lot of time has passed since those early years.
- **Interference:** New memories and information can interfere with early memories.
- **Changing Retrieval Cues:** As you grow, the cues that were present during your early years change.
- **Language Development:** Learning language transforms how your memory works, making it difficult to remember a time before language.
- **Brain Maturation:** Certain brain structures mature over time, leading to changes in memory.

### Amnesia

Amnesia can result from brain damage and is often depicted in movies like "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," "The Bourne Identity," and "Spellbound." There are two main types of amnesia:

1. **Retrograde Amnesia:**
   - This is the classic movie amnesia where a person loses memory of events before the accident or trauma. They forget who they are and their past experiences.

2. **Anterograde Amnesia:**
   - This type involves the inability to form new memories. An example is Clive Wearing, a world-renowned choir director who suffered brain damage from viral encephalitis. He constantly feels like he is waking up for the first time, as he cannot form new memories.

### Clive Wearing's Case

Clive Wearing's case is a dramatic example of anterograde amnesia. He suffers from extensive brain damage, including the destruction of both temporal lobes, his entire hippocampus, and most of his left frontal lobes. As a result:
- He has lost many past memories.
- He cannot form new memories, constantly feeling like he is waking up for the first time.

### Learning and Implicit Memory

Despite anterograde amnesia, individuals can still form new implicit memories and learn new skills:
- A standard task involves drawing a figure while looking in a mirror. People with amnesia can improve with practice, showing that they can form new implicit memories.
- They learn new things but are unaware of their learning. For example, HM, a famous patient with amnesia, could get better at a task without remembering having done it before.

### Memory Systems

There are at least two separate memory systems:
- **Explicit Memory:** Conscious memories of facts and events.
- **Implicit Memory:** Unconscious memories, such as skills and procedures.

### Movie Recommendations

Two movies that explore memory in interesting ways are:
- **Memento:** This film delves into the distinction between explicit and implicit memory.
- **50 First Dates:** A more lighthearted take on memory loss and its effects.

Understanding these different aspects of memory and forgetting helps us appreciate the complexity of how our brains store and retrieve information.
