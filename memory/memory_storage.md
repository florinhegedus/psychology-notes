### Information Processing Model

This famous diagram illustrates how information travels through the mind:

1. **Sensory Input**
   - **Sensory Memory**: Brief storage of sensory information.
     - **Examples**: Afterimage of a flash of lightning, echoic memory of spoken words.
     - **Function**: Allows you to briefly hold sensory information for processing.

2. **Attention**
   - **Working Memory (Short-term Memory)**: Information that you attend to moves here.
     - **Maintenance Rehearsal**: Repeating information (e.g., a phone number) to keep it in short-term memory.
     - **Duration**: Information not rehearsed or encoded is quickly lost.

3. **Long-term Memory**
   - **Storage**: Information from working memory can be encoded into long-term memory.
   - **Retrieval**: Information from long-term memory can be brought back into working memory.
   - **Capacity**: Virtually unlimited storage capacity, encompassing all known words, faces, stories, and experiences.
   - **Difference**: Unlike short-term memory, long-term memory has a much larger storage capacity.

### Key Distinctions in Memory

1. **Implicit vs. Explicit Memory**
   - **Explicit Memory**: Conscious knowledge (e.g., name, facts).
   - **Implicit Memory**: Unconscious knowledge (e.g., procedural skills, conditioned responses).

2. **Semantic vs. Episodic Memory**
   - **Semantic Memory**: Facts and general knowledge.
   - **Episodic Memory**: Personal experiences and episodes.

3. **Recall vs. Recognition**
   - **Recall**: Freely recounting information.
   - **Recognition**: Identifying the correct option from a set.

### Memory Processes

1. **Encoding**: Process of getting information into memory.
2. **Storage**: Keeping information in memory.
3. **Retrieval**: Getting information out of memory.

### Short-term Memory Limitations

- **Capacity**: Limited to 7 Â± 2 chunks, according to George Miller's "magic number."
- **Chunks**: Basic memory units, determined by knowledge and experience.

### Chunking and Expertise

- **Chunking**: Combining individual items into larger, meaningful units to enhance memory capacity.
  - **Example**: L-A-M-A-I-S-O-N can be eight separate letters, four English words, or one French word "LA MAISON."
- **Expertise**: Knowledge in a specific domain improves memory efficiency through better chunking.
  - **Examples**:
    - **Football Coaches**: Excellent memory for football diagrams.
    - **Architects**: Great memory for floor plans.
    - **Chess Players**: Superior memory for chess positions.

### Conclusion

Understanding memory involves recognizing different types of memory, processes of encoding, storage, and retrieval, and the limitations and capacities of short-term and long-term memory. Expertise and knowledge significantly enhance memory efficiency through chunking.
