### Perceiving Brightness: Context Matters

#### Initial Assumptions
- **Lump of Coal vs. Snowball**:
  - Common assumption: Coal is black, snowball is white.
  - Perception based on light intensity: Coal causes less neural firing due to less light, snowball causes more firing.

#### The Complexity of Brightness Perception
- **Beyond Light Intensity**: Brightness perception involves more than just the amount of light hitting the object.
- **Context Sensitivity**: Our perception is influenced by the context in which the object is situated.

#### Demonstration of Context Effect
- **Example with Two Squares**:
  - Two squares appear light and dark due to context (one in shadow, one in light).
  - Despite appearances, both squares are the same color.

#### Proving the Point
- **Removing External Cues**: By removing surrounding context, it becomes clear that the two squares are the same color.
- **Unconscious Compensation**:
  - The brain compensates for shadows by perceiving shadowed areas as lighter.
  - Conversely, areas in light are perceived as darker to maintain consistency.

#### Everyday Example
- **Walking into Shadow**:
  - When a person steps into a shadow, they appear darker, but the brain compensates, so they don't seem to change color dramatically.
  - **Assumption**: Shadows make surfaces darker; therefore, the brain adjusts perception to see shadowed surfaces as lighter than they appear.

### Summary
Perception of brightness is not merely about the amount of light that an object reflects. The brain uses context and makes unconscious adjustments to maintain consistent perception. This process allows us to perceive objects correctly even when lighting conditions change, illustrating the complexity and sophistication of our perceptual systems.
